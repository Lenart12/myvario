* 1.01
  - Changed to larger fonts in Varioplot for better visibility while thermalling

* 1.0:
  Changes from GliderSK:
  - Removed Safety features and tones (Different dynamic with paragliding)
  - Added vibration Vario for quiet flying
  - Added computation of wind direction speed
  - Changed general view to have wind direction and speed (acceleration and rate of turn removed)
  - Restricted views to General -> Vario -> Vario Plot/Thermal Assistant -> Log (removed other views)
  - Log view is skipped while the activity is recording (e.g. no need to check logs while in flight!)
  - Added auto-switch to Vario Plot when circling, and auto-switch back to previous view when no longer circling
  - Modified some default settings for paragliding use-case
  - Added additional vario plot ranges (0.5m/px and 0.25m/px)
  - Added a Minimum Climb setting for vario
  - Removed AutoSpeedStop / Renamed setting to Auto Start (need to stop manually - this is to avoid issues where glider appears to have null ground speed, but still flying)
  - Removed destinations, destination storage, destination import (removes the need for Communications permission)
  - Direction unit added (in degrees, or as direction sector such as NW)
