* 2.62
- Add support for Forerunner 265, 265s, 965

* 2.61
- Fix: Use GPS aviation mode when possible

* 2.60
- Updated Positioning settings to be automated for best compromise between
precision and battery life (GNSS watches will use SatIQ if available)
- Removed Positioning setting, as this is now automated
- Added support for Marq Gen 2 watches (all models) as well D2 Delta,
D2 Delta PX, and D2 Delta S watches

* 2.50
- Restricted application to GPS only (regardless of settings) until I can test
crash-causing changes in Garmin's latest firmware

* 2.47
- SDK 4.1.6

* 2.46
- Fine-tune circling detection

* 2.45
- Work around incorrect Garmin behavior with Boolean settings

* 2.44
- Improved under the hood setting handling

* 2.43
- Reverting to GPS only positioning due to change in behavior in Garmin
Alpha/Beta 10.xx firmwares
- Compatibility with new SDK 4.2.0

* 2.42
- Fixed a bug that caused the app to crash if the varioplot view was accessed
before a GPS fix was obtained.

* 2.41
- The Altitude in the thermal assistant now changes colors depending on how
much altitude has been gained (or lost) within the last 20 seconds. Red tones
for loss of altitude, green tones for gain of altitude, and gray for no change
or little change. This helps pilots understand at a glance how well they are
doing in a weak thermal.

* 2.40
- Added Live tracking integration with SportsTrackLive. To enable this
integration, the user will need to set up the SportsTrackLive login email
and password within the Connect IQ App (in the Settings section of My Vario).
Setting the update frequency (default off) is required for livetracking to
become effective.

* 2.32
- Fixed bug with thermal assistance wind correction (was applied 90 degrees off)
- Adjusted the non-circling detection for faster auto screen switch

* 2.31
- Added support for Edge 530

* 2.30
- Added support for small-wrist watches:
    Vivoactive 4S
    Forerunner 255S
    Venu 2S
  Note that the screen is really small and I don't think the indicators
  will be easily seen in flight

* 2.20
  - Added support for some touchscreen models:
    Vivoactive 4
    Venu 2
    Venu 2 Plus
    D2 Air
    D2 Air X10
  Special considerations apply (no tones for instance), see USAGE
- Optimized position mode for aviation

* 2.11
  - Added support for Forerunner 255 and 955

* 2.10
  - Added wind drift to the thermal detector

* 2.02
  - Added a new frequency option for livetracking

* 2.01
  - Added a timeout timer to the Livetrack24 login and track start requests
    so they can be attempted once a minute in case of issues

* 2.00
  - Added integration with Livetrack24. To enable this integration, the user
  will need to set their Livetrack24 login, password, and equipment name within
  the Connect IQ app. Setting the login to blank (default value) will disable the
  Livetrack24 function.

* 1.62
  - Added D2 Mach 1 to supported watches

* 1.61
  - Removed watches that don't support setting the GPS constellations. Those
  watches can use My Vario Lite instead.
  
* 1.60
  - Added an initial, automated altitude calibration upon startup,
  based on the watch-provided altitude
  - Added a new option to use GPS, GPS+GLONASS, or GPS+GALILEO in the app.
  unfortunately at this stage the SDK doesn't give access to GNSS for
  Fenix 7 or Epix Gen 2 watches (it still works, but what exact method is used
  is unknown). The default value is GPS+GLONASS.

* 1.51
  - Fixed layout issue in the Varioplot view with Epix Gen 2

* 1.50
  - Added the Epix (Gen 2) as a supported watch

* 1.40
  - Added the Forerunner 645 Music as a supported watch
  - Added thermal detection option (see USAGE)
  - Added marker of current location on varioplot
  - Limited varioplot to three minutes / 7-9 thermal circling to save memory
  - Replaced General view cell header/unit font to save memory

* 1.32
  - Fixed issue with vario tone frequencies and supported watches

* 1.31
  - Tweak tone curve to have continuous frequency values rather than discrete

* 1.3
  - Added a sink tone along with a sink tone threshold parameter

* 1.2
  - Added a proper tone, frequency, and vibration length curve (not user editable)

* 1.13
  - Fixed bug where vibrations wouldn't be triggered if tones were off

* 1.12
  - Changed activity name to My Vario

* 1.11
  - Added a smoothing parameter for the Kalman filter
  - Removed the GliderSK Lap feature for leaner application

* 1.1
  - Switched from a simple moving average filter to Kalman filter implementation
  - cleaned up all settings related to time constant and filtering

* 1.04
  - Removal of acceleration and rate of turn FIT fields and related filtering
  - Acceleration may be added back in the future, once Gyroscope data becomes
  available in Garmin SDK (for more reactive vario)

* 1.02 & 1.03
  - Amendment to Manifest & Changelog

* 1.01
  - Changed to larger fonts in Varioplot for better visibility while thermalling

* 1.0:
  Changes from GliderSK:
  - Removed Safety features and tones (App should NOT be used for safety)
  - Added vibration Vario for quiet flying
  - Added computation of wind direction and speed
  - Changed general view to have wind direction and speed (acceleration and rate of turn removed)
  - Restricted views to General -> Vario -> Vario Plot/Thermal Assistant -> Log (removed other views)
  - Log view is skipped while the activity is recording (e.g. no need to check logs while in flight!)
  - Added auto-switch to Vario Plot when circling, and auto-switch back to previous view when no longer circling
  - Modified some default settings for free flight use-case
  - Added additional vario plot ranges (0.5m/px and 0.25m/px)
  - Added a Minimum Climb setting for vario
  - Removed AutoSpeedStop / Renamed setting to Auto Start (need to stop manually - this is to avoid issues where glider appears to have null ground speed, but still flying)
  - Removed destinations, destination storage, destination import (removes the need for Communications permission)
  - Direction unit added (in degrees, or as direction sector such as NW)
