# My Vario (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
===============================
### A Variometer and tracker application for Garmin ConnectIQ devices


## Overview

My Vario is a fork of the excellent Glider SK - shortname for Glider Swiss
Knife. It has been modified and simplified free flight.
Features:
 - a Global view, displaying all flight data in a single pane: altitude,
   ground and vertical speeds, finesse, heading, wind direction and speed
   estimate, if available
 - a Variometer view, including variable-frequency tones to "sound" your
   ascent rate, as well as vibration-based "tones" to fly in silence
 - a Varioplot/thermal assistant view, allowing to keep track of your
   ascent/descent rate along your flight path
 - a Log view, allowing to keep track of your last activities
 - autoswitching to and from the varioplot/thermal assistant view with
   auto-circling detection


## Usage

Please refer to the USAGE file.

## Supported watches

I have reduced the number of watches supported compared to GliderSK. This
is because I am using variable frequency tones for the vario, which are
only supported for SDK 3.1.0 and above. I am testing this application on
my Garmin Fenix 7X.

## Not a programmer

I am not a programmer nor developer besides some small experience
contributing to N.I.N.A., an open-source astrophotography software suite.
Monkey C, Github, Garming SDK, etc are all new to me. I am a mere tinkerer
playing with and monkeying Cedric's work. It's likely I have introduced
errors, bugs, or code that could be extremely painful to the eyes of
experienced developers. I apologize for the pain caused!
You have been warned!
